# Prompt2Fashion: An automatically generated fashion dataset

This repository contains the dataset created with the methodology presented in our paper **"Automatic Generation of Fashion Images using Prompting in Generative Machine Learning Models"** (https://github.com/georgiarg/AutoFashion.git).


## Abstract

The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and fashion is revolutionizing the industry by enhancing creativity, personalization, and efficiency. From designing garments to predicting trends, AI is becoming an indispensable tool for fashion designers, retailers, and marketers. However, the integration of AI into fashion faces significant challenges, particularly in evaluating AI-generated content, which often requires domain expertise to ensure relevance, style, and appeal.

In this work, we present an automatically generated fashion image dataset focused on personalization. This dataset encompasses a variety of requirements, including gender, body type, occasions, and styles, along with their combinations. By leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) followed by a Diffusion Model, we offer a scalable solution for generating fashion images. Our approach eliminates the need for human intervention in designing the final outfit or even the conditioning prompt to the Diffusion Model.

The scalability of production facilitated by LLMs and Diffusion Models ensures a diverse range of fashion images can be generated efficiently. The quality guarantees provided by the LLMs in language generation, as well as the Diffusion Models in image generation, are validated by human evaluators. This validation process reflects how potential consumers perceive these AI-generated outfits, ensuring that the content is not only technically proficient but also resonates with current fashion trends and consumer preferences. 

Given that AI is making significant inroads into creative fields, it is crucial that human oversight regulates generated content. After all, fashion image synthesis frameworks are ultimately designed for experts in the field, such as fashion designers. These AI-generated images are likely to serve as preliminary steps in the creative process rather than the final product. Consequently, it is essential for AI-generated fashion content to be evaluated by individuals with domain expertise. To this end, in this work, we not only offer an open, automatically generated dataset for creatives and engineers but also emphasize the importance of involving experts in the evaluation process, based not only on the aforementioned notions but also on experimental findings.
